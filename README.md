# The Math
We have tried to explain three key concepts pertaining to algebra in a visual geometric way which gives a new flavour of interpretation to the concepts and is intuitive.
The concepts are:
1. Pythagoras Theorum
2. Geometrical Interpretation behind (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
3. Visualization of the property that sum of first n odd numbers is a perfct square.

# The Submission

1. To effectively to communicate mathematical concepts
2. To describe the equations using a visual and interactive medium

The key mathematical point is that often we do not appreciate the idea/derivations behind most of the mathematical concepts. Our submission delves into explaininng these concepts in an intuitive way.

The kind of interactions built into our project involve aspects like moving oround objects, keeping counts on number of square (Pythagoras submission) and interact with attractive and brightly lit shapes. We believe such visualizations stimulate the interest and kindles a sense of curiosity to further explore math.

Our target audience is anyone who has taken a basic math class. However the kids in middle school and high school would be able to appreciate it more and relate it to concepts in their cirriculum.
